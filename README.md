# Connected-Vehicles
This Repository is part of a larger Project within the class "Interaktionskonzept" at the HSHL. [link to project-base]

The goal is to simulate a Smart City, with multiple smaller actors and a central server. 

In this part, my task is to simulate a system that monitors the drivers in the city.
The system will monitor the drivers vitals and the crash detection of the car and release emergency messages in case a 
potential danger is detected.

For this, I will be using the CARLA-Software to simulate multiple cars driving around.
